    Serial communication may use from 5 to 8 bits.
    Parameters
    ----------
    data : The data to clip as a byte string.
    data_bits : How many bits per byte should be sent. Clip to this many bits.
        For example: data_bits=5: 0xff (0b1111_1111) --> 0x1f (0b0001_1111).
        Acceptable range is 5 to 8, inclusive. Values above 8 will be clipped to 8.
        This maps to the VISA attribute VI_ATTR_ASRL_DATA_BITS.
    send_end :
        If None (the default), apply the mask that is determined by data_bits.
        If False, apply the mask and set the highest (post-mask) bit to 0 for
        all bytes.
        If True, apply the mask and set the highest (post-mask) bit to 0 for
        all bytes except for the final byte, which has the highest bit set to 1.
