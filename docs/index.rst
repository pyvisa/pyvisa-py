PyVISA-py: Pure Python backend for PyVISA
=========================================

   :alt: PyVISA


PyVISA-py is a backend for PyVISA_. It implements most of the methods
for Message Based communication (Serial/USB/GPIB/Ethernet) using Python
and some well developed, easy to deploy and cross platform libraries.
The pyvisa_py module is not intended to be imported anywhere in your
code, instead follow the instructions below for using it.

You can select the PyVISA-py backend using **@py** when instantiating the
visa Resource Manager:

    >>> import pyvisa
    >>> rm = pyvisa.ResourceManager('@py')
    >>> rm.list_resources()
    ('USB0::0x1AB1::0x0588::DS1K00005888::INSTR')
    >>> inst = rm.open_resource('USB0::0x1AB1::0x0588::DS1K00005888::INSTR')
    >>> print(inst.query("*IDN?"))


That's all! Except for **@py**, the code is exactly what you would write to
using the NI-VISA backend for PyVISA.


Installation
============

Just run the following command in your console:

    pip install pyvisa-py


You can report a problem or ask for features in the `issue tracker`_.
Or get the code in GitHub_.


FAQ
===


Which libraries are used by PyVISA-py?
--------------------------------------

It depends on the interface type. For **ASRL** and **USB** we use PySerial_ and PyUSB_,
respectively. PySerial_ version 3.0 or newer is required.

For **TCPIP** we use the :py:mod:`socket` module in the Python Standard Library.

On Linux, **GPIB** resources are supported using the `linux-gpib`_ project's Python bindings.
On Windows as well as Linux systems with proprietary GPIB device drivers, experimental GPIB
support is available through `gpib-ctypes`_. The `gpib-ctypes`_ library is still in
development so please report any issues you may encounter.


If I only need **TCPIP**, do I need to install PySerial, PyUSB, linux-gpib, or gpib-ctypes?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

No. Libraries are loaded on demand.


How do I know if PyVISA-py is properly installed?
-------------------------------------------------

Using the pyvisa information tool. Run in your console::

  pyvisa-info

You will get info about PyVISA, the installed backends and their options.


Which resource types are supported?
-----------------------------------

Now:

- ASRL INSTR
- USB INSTR
- TCPIP INSTR
- USB RAW
- TCPIP SOCKET
- GPIB INSTR



Are all VISA attributes and methods implemented?
------------------------------------------------

No. We have implemented those attributes and methods that are most commonly
needed. We would like to reach feature parity. If there is something that you
need, let us know.


Why are you developing this?
----------------------------

The `National Instruments's VISA`_ is a proprietary library that only works on certain systems.
We wanted to provide a compatible alternative.


Why not using LibreVISA?
------------------------

LibreVISA_ is still young. However, you can already use it with the NI backend
as it has the same API. We think that PyVISA-py is easier to hack and we can
quickly reach feature parity with NI-VISA for message-based instruments.


Why putting PyVISA in the middle?
---------------------------------

Because it allows you to change the backend easily without changing your application.
In other projects we implemented classes to call USBTMC devices without PyVISA.
But this leads to code duplication or an adapter class in your code.
By using PyVISA as a frontend to many backends, we abstract these things
from higher level applications.
